# WP-Gulp-Env
A Gulp environment to build and deploy Wordpress themes.

I needed a simple Gulp-based collection of tasks to develop Wordpress themes in a local dev directory, automatically deploy to a local staging environment and finally push to the production server. So far, this includes CSS-, JavaScript- and image minification including watch tasks, browser sync, and automatic generation of style.css and .pot files.
